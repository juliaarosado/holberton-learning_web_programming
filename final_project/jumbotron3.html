          <p>At the surface, Splatoon is just a colorful squid shooter game where the goal is to paint more of the floor than the enemy team. But in reality, Splatoon is set in a post apocalyptic world in which humans have been wiped out and sentient squids and octopi have emerged as the superior, intellegent race.</p>

      <h2>The Great Turf War</h2>
      <div class= "row">
        <div class= "col">

      <div class="col">
          <p>12,000 years before the events of Splatoon, global warming caused every land mass to flood, effectively wiping out humans. 10,000 years later, once water levels had receeded, the sea creatures were forced to evolve and adapt to live on land, causing many of them to lose their ability to survive in water.
        Squids and octopi evolved into Inklings and Octolings, groups who began to build their own civilizations once on the surface by utilizing and treasuring Zapfish- evolved forms of catfish that generated electricity. They managed to live in peace for 1,900 years, until water levels rose again and the two races began
        to fight over the remaining land. This plunged the two groups into a 100 year long war- The Great Turf War.</p>
          <p>Octolings, being a more technologically advanced species, dominated Inklings early in the war, as Inklings were canonically "unable to wake up early enough in the morning to defend themselves." Octolings easily overpowered Inklings with their Great Octoweapons, which made appearances in the hero
          campaigns of both Splatoon and Splatoon 2 as bosses. However, the Inklings managed to win the war after a plug powering the Great Octoweapons was accidentally unplugged, forcing Octolings underground.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>After the Great Turf War, Inkopolis Plaza became the hub for everything hip and cool, or as it's referred to in the game, "fresh." Two pop idol groups are formed- the Squid Sisters and Off the Hook, one for each game. Many bands were also formed in Splatoon which include a wide variety of species, from humanoid urchins
      to lobsters to anemonies. These bands are also responsible for the music that plays in multiplayer battles in both games. The clothing, dialogue, and music of Splatoon are based off skater and street style trends, and the goal for most Inklings is to be "the freshest kid out there." True to the laidback and careless nature of Inklings,
      they turn the idea of the Great Turf War into a sport- Turf War, where squads of four compete to paint as much of a battle stage as possible. Life seems good for the Inklings, whose days are mostly occupied by turfing, listening to music, and looking fresh. In the official Splatoon manga, most Inklings are really ignorant of what's going
      on around them, and just focus on having fun.</p>
      <h2>Splatoon Game Modes</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p> Like any game, Splatoon has multiple types of multiplayer modes and story modes. The multiplayer mode with the most story behind it is Salmon Run, a player vs. environment mode where teams of four defeat Salmonids and harvest their eggs for a "sketchy" company, Grizzco Industries. Not much is known about Grizzco or its
          owner, Mr. Grizz, who is portrayed as a bear-shaped radio. Salmonids are based off of real salmons, and come in 14 types, with 10 being bosses. Salmonids are said to have emerged out of the toxic and dirty waters outside Inkopolis. They use frying pans and other cooking tools as weapons, which were left behind by humans.
          The mode of Salmon Run was meant to mimick the actual journey salmons make to lay eggs but reimagined as a video game horde mode. Though there isn't a lot of information about Grizzco, there are many player theories that are widely accepted. For example, salmon eat squids, and bears eat salmon. It's theorized that Mr. Grizz,
          a bear, uses Inklings a bait for the Salmonids, who then drop the eggs that they were planning to lay so he can then eat the Salmonids or their eggs.</p><br>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>Splatoon 2 also has two story modes- one that comes with the game and one that is a DLC. The free story mode mimicks that of the story mode of the first game. The player is recruited to join the Squidbeak Splatoon, the group who fought in the Great Turf War that is led by an old man, Cap'n Cuttlefish. They become an agent whose goal
          is to retrieve the Great Zapfish which powers Inkopolis and was stolen by the Octarians because their underground domes are collapsing and losing power.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
        <p>The second story mode is longer, more difficult, and darker. It takes place on the Deepsea Metro, an underground subway system, with Cap'n Cuttlefish as a supporting character. The player wakes up as an Octoling who has lost all their memories, and must complete a series of tests to regain them and collect the four "thangs" that will open the door to the "promised land" (the surface).
          Once they have collected and assembled all four thangs, the player realizes they have actually built a blender, and the Commander Tartar, a telephone created by humans 12,000 years ago to pass on knowledge to the next sentient species reveals that they player is going to be broken down into raw materials to build his perfect race. At the last second, Agent 3, the playable agent from Splatoon
          crashes into the Deepsea Metro to resuce Cap'n Cuttlefish and the player. This begins the escape phase, in which the player has to complete seven levels to reach the surface. Once at the surface, they realize that Commander Tartar has built a machine that they intend to use to destroy all of Inkopolis. They then explain to the player that after waiting 12,000 years, they became jaded and cynical,
          and watching Inklings and Octolings fight over a DNA deviation made them realize that they do not deserve knowledge, so they created the subway to harvest "primoridal sludge" from test takers that would help them build a new civilization after Inkopolis was destroyed.</p>

      <p> I think the thought that developers put into Splatoon's lore and its character's backstories (which weren't mentioned because there's so many) is really amazing and adds depth to the game. With so many modes and aspects of the game, there really is something that suits everyone's playstyle or preference, whether it's reading the lore, playing the game or just customizing your character.
        Even though it's just a video game and this is taking it out of context, I think the past events of Splatoon kind of serve as a warning for the future about climate change, because water levels are rising
        so drastically. But if I'm reincarnated as an Inkling 12,000 years in the future because humanity was wiped out I honestly wouldn't be mad.</p>
