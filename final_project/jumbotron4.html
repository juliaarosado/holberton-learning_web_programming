          <p>Final Destination</p>
          <p>A classic. The lack of stage hazards and excessive platforms/structures allow for a fair playing field and the changing background looks sick. A go-to choice for parties or just chilling. 10/10</p>

          <p>Another classic, but this time with platforms which aid mobility. Big Battlefield adds platforms which makes playing with 7 other people a lot easier if you can organize 7 people to be in the same place at the same time. I like the plants. 10/10 </p>

          <p>Basically Final Destination but with a minor stage hazard. Watching King Bulbin run across the map is all fun and games until you're not paying attention and die. The middle is a pain if you main someone without good recovery or projectiles. 8/10 </p>

          <p>Amazing stage from an amazing game. The characters in the back and the music add nostalgia and seeing the town underneath the stage is a nice touch. It's hard to get the items that spawn on the platform though. 8/10 </p>

          <p>A great stage because it caters to a lot of playstyles. For example if you suck and rack up a lot of damage early in the match you can chill in the middle where it's supposedly harder to get KO'd. Another big stage that's good for large groups. 8/10</p>

          <p>A pretty cool stage, again from a great game. The fact that the layout changes all the time is kind of reminiscent of the way every player's town is different in the series. The fruits and bugs are a nice touch too. 7/10</p>

          <p>Another huge stage but it's a lot harder to move around on and the cameras don't zoom well, making it hard to play. I used to be scared of the Ultimate Chimera but now I think it's pretty cute. 7/10</p>

          <p>Pikmin was a cool game in concept but I remember getting really frustrated because it was hard so I have beef with this stage. The rain is deadly when it catches you off guard or if someone throws you into it. The Bulborb is too but it's cute so it gets a pass. 6/10</p>

          <p>The curve of the stage and the altered gravity is a cool idea until you try to fight on it. This stage is not fun if you are one of those people who rely heavily on projectiles. I like the details of the background and how it brings together details from both games. 6/10</p>

          <p>Again, I don't like scolling stages but this one is a little more tolerable because it's significantly slower than Big Blue. The obstacles can make it hard to keep moving but at least there's solid ground under you. Sakurai has confirmed that he wanted the stage to look like Mushroom Kingdom had been abandoned since it debuted in 1985 and I think that was a nice touch. 3/10</p>

          <p>Moray Towers</p>
          <p>An amazing game, but an absolutly awful stage. The original Moray Towers stage from Splatoon was already one of the most widely hated maps in the community and somehow the Smash developers made it even worse.
          It's nearly impossible to run on thanks to the placement of soft platforms. It's only playable in Battlefiled or Omega form, and the music that plays in the background is its only redeeming quality. 0/10 </p>
